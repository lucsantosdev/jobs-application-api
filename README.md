## 🚀 Project Description  
This is a REST API using Sequelize and Typescript, as well as the Node.js Express framework and the PostgreSQL database. This API simulates the backend of a Job Application. In this app, candidates can register and then apply for jobs. Companies can also register and create job openings for candidates to apply for.

## ✨ Functionalities  
- **Database:** Sequelize CLI configuration and table creation through migrations, seeders and their models. 
- **Endpoints:** Separation of application logic into route files and controllers that work with REST requests (create, read, update and delete) received.
- **Relationships in Sequelize:** Implementation and management of relationships between database table data (One-to-Many Relationships and Many-to-Many Relationships).
